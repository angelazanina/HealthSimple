Believe you can and you’re halfway there.
Failure is not the opposite of success: it’s part of success.
If your dreams don’t scare you, they are too small.
The difference between ordinary and extraordinary is that little extra.
It always seems impossible until it’s done.
Every accomplishment starts with the decision to try. 
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Just keep going. You never know how far you can go.
You learn more from losing than winning. You learn how to keep going.
Things aren't always easy, but you just have to keep going and don't let the small stuff bog you down.
You must do the things you think you cannot do
If you really think small, your world will be small. If you think big, your world will be big
You are loved just for being who you are, just for existing
The chance to love and be loved exists no matter where you are
Are you good enough? Yes, you are!
Your life is about to be incredible
Your perspective is unique. It’s important and it counts
Who you are inside is what helps you make and do everything in life
Every day above earth is a good day
Nothing can dim the light that shines from within
Your life is already a miracle of chance waiting for you to shape its destiny
Hold up your head! You were not made for failure, you were made for victory,
Embrace the glorious mess that you are
Nothing is impossible. The word itself says 'I’m possible!'
Failure is just another way to learn how to do something right
Have coffee in one hand, confidence in the other
Your potential is endless

I'm so proud of you!

You got this!

I think you're doing so good!
