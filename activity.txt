Go for a walk!
Take a break and stretch a bit :)
Some yoga could be quite relaxing.
Stand up and get a nice stretch in!
Let's do 10 jumping jacks to get our blood flow going.
Ease your stress and dance it out!
If possible, go for a light jog today.
Relax, stretch, and keep track of that posture!
Have some fun, do some squats!
If the weathers looking nice, a short walk outdoors could freshen your mind.
Put work on pause and do a little bit of arm circles.
